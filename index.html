        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year student at Lehigh University studying Computer Science and Engineering. 
            I am passionate about software engineering and cybersecurity. I am proficient in Java, Python, Excel, and C++, 
            with experience in Swift, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy learning through personal projects and 
            continuously developing my skills. I am currently finishing an ISC2 Cybersecurity course and plan to acquire more certifications.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Applied Engineering Computer Methods Course and Lab
                <ul>
                    <li>Used python to solve Engineering problems, utalizing file reading and writing, regression and  plotting graphs.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>Labs consisted of using a Raspberry Pi to develop a robot to solve a variety of challenges, ending with  
                        implementing machine learning to autonoumously drive and steer the robot away from obstacles.

                <ul>
                    <li>Utilized TypeScript to develop a basic racing video game which included a dynamic shifting background, different 
                        difficulty levels and settings, and many different objects which served as obstacles in the game.
                    </li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Problem-solving using the Java programming language. I used data types, control flow, methods, arrays, objects, 
                        and inheritance to solve a variety of issues.</li>
                </ul>

                Introduction to Programming and Data Structures Course
                <ul>
                    <li>Used java to design and implementat algorithms and data structures. Built off prior experience using 
                        conditional statements, loops, arrays, and  object-oriented programming. Developed algorithmic 
                        techniques such as recursion, algorithm analysis, and sortin and implementated data structures 
                        such as lists, queues, stacks, trees, and hash tables.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Basic representations used in algorithms: propositional and predicate logic, set operations and functions, 
                        relations and their representations, matrices and their representations, graphs and their representations, 
                        trees and their representations. Basic formalizations for proving algorithm correctness: logical consequences, 
                        induction, structural induction. Basic formalizations for algorithm analysis: counting, pigeonhole principle,
