        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year student at Lehigh University studying Computer Science and Engineering. 
            I am passionate about software engineering and cybersecurity. I am proficient in Java, Python, Excel, and C++, 
            with experience in Swift, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I enjoy learning through personal projects and 
            continuously developing my skills. I am currently finishing an ISC2 Cybersecurity course and plan to acquire more certifications.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Sample Netflix System
                    <ul>
                        <li> Developed a simple alterable Netflix System incorporating a sample system of selectable options 
                            practicing creating and altering arrays of content, storing and altering large amounts of information
                            for different users, and utilized multiple classes and functions to simplify the main code.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    Sample Media List
                    <ul>
                        <li> Developed a proof of concept program using multiple abstract parent and child classes to define different
                            types of Media. With these objects, I read and wrote the sample list to a file, ran different types of searches 
                            and sorts over them all, and implemented various catches to improve my programming and problem-solving skills.

                    Many, many more
                    <ul>
                        <li> Hundreds of proof of concept and test programs to practice and master various topics, such as object-oriented 
                            programming, creating and manipulating arrays, reading and writing to files, utilizing recursion, and creating and 
                            manipulating variables to store all types of input and accomplish any problem.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Artificial Intelligence Course
                <ul>
                    <li>Used the basics of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to operate a car that could autonomously 
                        drive while using detecting road signs, pedestrians, and stop lights. This car was programmed and trained on 
                        data comprised of pictures of our "road" to isolate the lines and relevant objects to accurately navigate
                        situations.  
                    </li>
